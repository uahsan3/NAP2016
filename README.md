Refugee Resettlement Tool for New American Pathways DSSG 2016

This is a tool we built over our summer internship as part of the Data Science for Social Good 2016 in Atlanta. Our partner
organization was New American Pathways and the tool is for visualization of various data sources and other information for
resettlement agencies to select the best possible locations for affordable apartments for refugee families. 

The data folder contains all our data files. 
Docs folder contains the documentation and the main file that executes the web tool is app.R.
